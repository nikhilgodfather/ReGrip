            Regrip recognizes the importance of privacy. Regrip is committed to protecting the privacy of registered users ("users") of its application ("the Platform"), clients, shareholders, and suppliers. This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect, hold, use, and disclose information (including an opinion) about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable ("Personal Information"). Personal Information collected by Regrip will be stored through electronic systems located in various jurisdictions. Please note that the jurisdictions to which Personal Information may be transferred may not provide the equivalent level of data protection as the laws in your home country. This does not, however, change Regrip's commitment to keeping Personal Information secure.

            If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact write to : <a href="tyres@regrip.in">tyres@regrip.in</a>
